# Use at your own risk

Right now i have not tested these anywhere and every where.

I know they work on MAC OS X Yosemite. Thats all that has been tested.

From here forward I will attempt to make them platform independent but that is not guaranteed.


#Saftey checks

Every script checks to ensure you have a set of configured variables. 
To look at the defaults read *.rancherProfile.default* it has a suggested default for these variables.
Other wise you can make your own.
